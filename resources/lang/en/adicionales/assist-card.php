    'faq5_sale_answer' => '<p>Assist Card consists of a network of companies dedicated to the provision of traveler\'s assistance services all over the world.&nbsp; In general terms, traveler assistance services are those provided directly by the assistance company and are geared toward assisting travelers at the very moment an inconvenient takes place during their trip, and not simply to compensate them when they return from it, as an insurance company would.</p>
                        <p>Assist Card provides a wide range of assistance services to people during their trips, including cashless medical care; Legal assistance (through the recommendation of local attorneys); assistance in the search and location of baggage; Concierge services including, for example, airline ticket bookings, information and assistance in case of loss of documents, etc.</p>
                        <p>Thus, Assist Card is not an insurance company nor acts as such, but provides its customers with the services mentioned above through a network of professionals around the world.</p>',
