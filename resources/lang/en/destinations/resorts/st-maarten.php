    <p>Discover an island that blends the legacy of two European cultures: France and the Netherlands, together with all the beauty of a&nbsp;<strong>Caribbean</strong>&nbsp;getaway where the skies are the only borderlines.&nbsp;<strong>St. Maarten</strong>&nbsp;is located at the northern of the Lesser Antilles, southeast of Puerto Rico, offering a place full of wonders and passion that should be explored on your vacations. Sail across the waters that divide the Atlantic Ocean from the Caribbean Sea and climb the legendary mount of Concordia, live to explore your own spirit in paradise.</p>

    <p><strong>Sint Maarten</strong>, the Dutch area of&nbsp;<strong>St. Maarten</strong>, holds the important port of Philipsburg, also a major cruise ship destination. This waterfront town boasts a variety of duty free shops, jewelries selling dazzling diamonds and emeralds, restaurants, bars, casinos and clubs. Naval heroes, pirates and smugglers, merchants, estate owners and slaves have all left their mark here, and rumors of a buried treasure still persist! The island is certainly a historical gem decorated by natural beauty.</p>

    <p>At Philipsburg two of the major resorts of&nbsp;<strong>St. Maarten</strong>&nbsp;are located to offer you prime accommodations, services and amenities during your stay:&nbsp;<strong>Simpson Bay Beach Resort &amp; Marina</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>The Villas at Simpson Bay Beach Resort &amp; Marina</strong>.</p>
