    <p>The rich history of different nations gave life to a fascinating place such as&nbsp;<strong>Curacao</strong>, the largest island in the Netherlands Antilles designated as an UNESCO World Heritage, for its idyllic beaches, underwater gardens of coral reefs, and an intriguing mix of cultural and architectural heritage. The picturesque buildings and colorful merchant houses overlooking the harbor, blend the colonial styles of the Netherlands and Spain with the warm&nbsp;<strong>Caribbean</strong>&nbsp;soul.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

    <p>All travelers during their&nbsp;<strong>Curacao vacations&nbsp;</strong>should visit the Cristoffel and Shete Boca National Parks, the Den Paradera, the Herb Garden, Hato Caves and the Ostrich Farm. Besides, with over 65 dive sites, pristine reefs close to the shore, over 500 species of fish and a host of other colorful marine creatures, caves, drop offs and shipwrecks,&nbsp;<strong>Curacao</strong>&nbsp;is a diver&rsquo;s dream.</p>

    <p><strong>The Royal Sea Aquarium Resort</strong>&nbsp;is a beautiful place with sheltered, beautiful and palm-lined beaches, one of the best places to stay in the island and live memorable&nbsp;<strong>Curacao vacations</strong>. The aquarium, right next to the resort, is well worth a visit, as it offers resort guests&nbsp;<strong>free</strong>&nbsp;<strong>access</strong>&nbsp;to see the reefs of the&nbsp;<strong>Caribbean</strong>&nbsp;up close without getting wet and endless aquatic fun and interesting facts about the marine ecology of the area, besides being home to the Dolphin Academy, one of the top dolphin facilities in the&nbsp;<strong>Caribbean</strong>&nbsp;offering encounters with these wonderful creatures.</p>
