Royal Reservations will take the necessary measures in both the IT (information technology) and the human factors to prevent and avoid, as far as possible, the misuse, alteration and filtering of your personal information.

        <h2>Personal information we collect automatically</h2>
        <p class='text-justify'>

        </p>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            When you make a reservation with us, our system registers the information about the media and the web pages from where you have made it.
        </p>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            All of the above for the sole purpose of helping us offering you the best possible service.
        </p>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            At Royal Reservations we do not handle any kind of personal and/or sensitive information that may endanger our users in anyway.
        </p>

        <h2>Why do we collect your information?</h2>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            We use the information we collect about you for a variety of reasons:
        </p>

        <h2>Reservations</h2>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            We use your personal data to complete and manage your online bookings. We do this through our online services, and if you choose to book with us, we will use your personal information to complete and manage your accommodation request as if you had done so directly at the hotel.
        </p>

        <h2>Customer Service</h2>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            We provide personalized attention and assistance services to the traveler, in an ample schedule, every day of the year. By having your data you allow us to give a quick and concrete response to your needs. This includes from helping you find the ideal accommodation, according to your needs, to answering any questions you may have about your reservation.
        </p>

        <h2>Marketing actions</h2>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            Depending on the data you share with us, we will personalize the marketing information we'll show you or send you, whether by email, ads on websites or social media platforms. This information may be about offers that can be reserved directly on the Royal Reservations website or relevant information for you, according to your tastes.
        </p>

        <h2>Communication via email</h2>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            When you book with us or subscribe to our newsletter, we use your contact details, such as your email address, to send you news about travel-related products and services. Royal Reservations will not send more than 10 messages per month and you'll never be contacted without your consent. You can unsubscribe from our marketing communications list in an easy and quick way, whenever you want. Just click on the link 'Unsubscribe' that appears in each newsletter.
        </p>

        <h2>Internet ads</h2>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            We also use the information we collect in order to show the users ads through the web that are totally relevant to them. Once these advertisements have appeared, we collect information about where they were shown and which of them received clicks; this is just for statistical, measurement of results and quality control reasons.
        </p>

        <h2>Social media</h2>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            At Royal Reservations, we use social media for different purposes. While we offer online booking services, we also promote travel-related services and other products according to your preferences. In addition to the above mentioned, we also use them to promote contests, information about destinations, among others. We also use social media messaging services, such as Facebook®, so that you can interact with Royal Reservations.
        </p>

        <h2>Communication with You</h2>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            As we mentioned before, there will be other occasions when we contact you either via email or through publications; we do this for the following reasons:
        </p>

        <p class='text-justify'> 
            When you have not finished your reservation online yet, we send you a reminder so that you continue with your reservation process. The above will help you to proceed with the reservation without having to search for your hotel or fill in the details of your booking again.
        </p>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            It is possible that when you make a reservation with us, we invite you to give us your opinion about your experience with Royal Reservations.
        </p>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            We will also send you relevant information regarding your reservation, for example: how to contact Royal Reservations, information about the resort you have chosen or information that we think may be useful when planning your vacation in order to get the most out of your stay. In addition, we may send you material related to new promotions and offers to encourage you to travel again, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Comments and reviews</h2>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            When you book through Royal Reservations, we will invite you to share your opinion about your experience when booking, your experience at the hotel or any other comments or reviews you wish to let us know. In addition, your comments can be published anonymously if you prefer it that way. 
        </p>

        <h2>Personalized service</h2>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            During calls with the Royal Reservations customer service and assistance staff, said calls can be recorded for security, fraud investigation and quality control reasons. These recordings are saved for a limited time and are automatically deleted. All call recordings will be made in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which will be informed to you during the phone call.
        </p>

        <h2>Improving our Service</h2>
        <p class='text-justify'> 
            We use your personal information to conduct analytical studies. This is part of the work we do to improve our services, for the purpose of improving the user experience, but it can also be used to carry out tests, solve problems and improve the functionality and quality of our website and our booking engine. The primary objective of this is to optimize and personalize our website and our booking engine to suit your needs, making them easier and more enjoyable to use.
